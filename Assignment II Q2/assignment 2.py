"""
Australian Temperature Analysis (Recursive Version with Comments)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This program processes ALL .csv files under the "temperatures" folder.
Each CSV represents yearly data from multiple weather stations.

Functions:
  1. Seasonal averages across ALL stations & years
  2. Station(s) with the largest temperature range
  3. Most stable & most variable stations (by standard deviation)

Outputs (saved in text files):
  - average_temp.txt
  - largest_temp_range_station.txt
  - temperature_stability_stations.txt
